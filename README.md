# Minishell

This project is a custom shell implementation, built as part of the 42 school curriculum.  It aims to recreate a simplified version of a standard Unix shell (like bash).

## Compilation and Usage

### Prerequisites

*   A C compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
*   The `make` utility

### Compilation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/goncalotr/42_minishell_project.git
    cd minishell
    ```

2.  **Compile:**

    ```bash
    make
    ```

    This will create an executable named `minishell`.

### Usage
